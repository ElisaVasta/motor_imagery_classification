# EEG Signal Classification for Imaginary Hand Movement

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of imaginary right and left hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Through analyzing 3-channel EEG signals, we have developed a methodology to distinguish between these two cognitive states.

## Data Recording
Details about the data recording process, the experimental setup, and the participants can be found in the `Paper_EEG` document within this repository. This paper provides in-depth information about the EEG signal acquisition and the preprocessing steps that were taken to prepare the data for analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Paper_EEG` document to understand the data recording and preprocessing.
3. Explore the datasets and the analysis scripts provided in the repository.

## Analysis
The analysis involves several steps including signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and the application of machine learning algorithms for classification. The scripts and notebooks detailing this process are included in the repository.
